fix: resolve database creation transaction error

## Additional Problem Found
After fixing env variables, discovered database creation issue:
- init-db.sh only runs on first volume creation
- If volume exists, script doesn't run again
- Bot tries to create DB but uses `begin()` which starts transaction
- CREATE DATABASE cannot run inside transaction → error

## Solution
1. **Fixed database.py**: Changed `admin_engine.begin()` to `admin_engine.connect()` 
   with `isolation_level='AUTOCOMMIT'` for CREATE DATABASE command
   
2. **Created FIX_DB_ISSUE.sh**: Script to remove postgres volume and recreate
   - Stops containers
   - Removes old volume (triggers init-db.sh on next start)
   - Rebuilds and starts services
   
3. **Updated safe_redeploy.sh**: Added `--clean` flag to optionally remove DB
   - `./scripts/safe_redeploy.sh` - keeps DB
   - `./scripts/safe_redeploy.sh --clean` - fresh DB

4. **Updated documentation**: 
   - QUICK_FIX_NOW.md - immediate fix instructions
   - ACTION_PLAN_NOW.md - step-by-step guide
   - DEPLOY_CHEATSHEET.md - added --clean flag info

## Technical Details

**Before (database.py):**
```python
async with admin_engine.begin() as conn:  # starts transaction
    await conn.execute(text(f'CREATE DATABASE "{POSTGRES_DB}"'))
```

**After (database.py):**
```python
async with admin_engine.connect() as conn:
    await conn.execution_options(isolation_level='AUTOCOMMIT').execute(
        text(f'CREATE DATABASE "{POSTGRES_DB}"')
    )
```

## How to Fix on Server

```bash
git pull
./FIX_DB_ISSUE.sh
```

Or use updated safe_redeploy:
```bash
./scripts/safe_redeploy.sh --clean
```

## Note about WARNING
```
WARNING: The POSTGRES_PASSWORD variable is not set
```
This appears during `docker-compose down` BEFORE `git pull` (old config).
It's harmless - ignore it. After pull, new config works correctly.

Changes:
- Modified: soul_bot/database/database.py, scripts/safe_redeploy.sh, DEPLOY_CHEATSHEET.md
- Created: FIX_DB_ISSUE.sh, QUICK_FIX_NOW.md, ACTION_PLAN_NOW.md
